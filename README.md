# Wordy-Gurdy
A max 4 live MIDI effect that turns characters in to MIDI.

Inspired by the wonderful [ixi lang](http://www.ixi-audio.net/ixilang/), [Type Drummer](http://typedrummer.com/) and [MMODM](mmodm.co) this thing takes in a string of text and spits out MIDI notes. It can hence be used to produce melodies, rhythms, drive light shows or turn on and off your kettle.

Punctuation and spaces are silent and capital letters are accented by the Capital Velocity amount.

Each letter in the alphabet can be assigned a MIDI note of your choice.

The sequence steps can be triggered by an internal clock or by MIDI notes fed through it allowing it to be used as a weird arpegiator type thing or consume Live's grooves.
